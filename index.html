      <h4 class="strong"><strong>Not What I Hoped</strong></h4>
      <p>For years I dreamed that my life would turn out a certain way; that I would marry, be successful in a career and have 2.5 kids by the time I was thirty. 30 came and went. I wasn’t doing anything I thought I would have done – not to suggest I didn’t live life but I wasn’t living the life I had imagined for myself. I was on auto-pilot and my pilot was drunk.
      </p>
      <p>When I conceived my son, I was 36, working in a brewery and living the single life in a college town. I realized that I had a choice to make. A GIGANTIC decision to make. I sat with it until I realized “I already made my choice”. This is when I knew that I needed to make different life choices. I needed to make choices that would alter my reality entirely; so I did. I took the first steps. I moved back home.</p>
      <h4 class="strong"><strong>Best They Could with What They Had</strong></h4>
      <p>At 19 years old, my mother lost her father, very suddenly. Followed by an unexpected pregnancy with a man that was violent and had some major issues. They were married not necessarily by choice, but most certainly out of expectation. She tried. They tried, to make it work until she couldn’t anymore.</p>
      <p>I share this to recognize her, as a person – a mother who was in pain and took steps that she knew she had to, to break a cycle of trauma. There were many bumps in the road and it wasn’t an instant fix, but it was what was within her power at that time. She did the best with what she had. And now it’s my turn.</p>
      <p>The thing about intergenerational trauma is that it shows up in ways that we may not even recognize. It’s been normalized. The behaviours and traits of the family are ‘bred’ into us, in a sense. The catch is: that when we know better, it’s our responsibility to do better.</p>
      <h4 class="strong"><strong>Our children, our grace</strong></h4>
      <p>Becoming a parent is the most profound shift we may ever have in our lives. In just 4 years of my son’s life, I have learned more about myself, my family and (best yet) him, than I ever did before. Our children hold up a proverbial mirror in ways no other human could. You’ll see parts of yourself that you never knew existed. Your ugly bits, and the most spectacular. Our children reflect these parts of us and amplify them. I believe this happens for us to grow. To dig deep to the roots of the pain and work it out. To take steps the way our parents did for us, and their parents for them. To do the best with what we have.</p>

      <h4 class="strong"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

      <p>We aren’t here to be perfect, but I do believe we’re here to leave this world better than we found it, for everyone. Especially for our children.</p>

      <p>The healing is going to hurt sometimes and it will not be easy, but it’s our responsibility. Being able to look our children in the eyes knowing that we are doing our best with what we have, I consider that a win.</p>
