      <p>For years I dreamed that my life would turn out a certain way; that I would marry, be successful in a career and have 2.5 kids by the time I was thirty. 30 came and went. I wasn’t doing anything I thought I would have done – not to suggest I didn’t live life but I wasn’t living the life I had imagined for myself. I was on auto-pilot and my pilot was drunk.
      </p>
      <p>When I conceived my son, I was 36, working in a brewery and living the single life in a college town. I realized that I had a choice to make. A GIGANTIC decision to make. I sat with it until I realized “I already made my choice”. This is when I knew that I needed to make different life choices. I needed to make choices that would alter my reality entirely; so I did. I took the first steps. I moved back home.</p>
